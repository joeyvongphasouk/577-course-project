## Need to Know stuffs
- Font size for menu is 40 px
- Player collision layer + mask is 2, grapple coll layer + mask is 1, thus blocks in env should check for both
- Audio for sound effects: https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-packs/footsteps-on-hollow-wood-floor/?registration_redirect=1&item_id=40163

### 1 - 3d puzzle grapple hook physics game what
A 3D platformer game where the player must navigate a level from a designated start and end point. The player can shoot a grappling hook at specific points along the level. The player can use this interaction to swing off of this point to reach parts of a level.

Potent prob:
1. Momentum and physics is shit to debug
2. Edge cases are also shit to debug
3. Levels themselves must be designed well
